# My First Python Project ðŸŽ‰

This is my first Python project. It greets users based on their input using a simple function.

## How to Run:

1. **Install Python** from [python.org](https://python.org).
2. **Run the following command** in your terminal or command prompt:
python greet_user.py

3. **Enter your name** when prompted, and enjoy the greeting!

## Future Improvements:
- Add error handling for invalid inputs.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) version.
- Add additional features, such as a personalized message based on age.
